#Minesweeper Marathon

##Gameplay
###Minesweeper Marathon is a twist on the traditional game of Minesweeper

players begin with a 3x3 game board with 4 Mines
the player has 60 seconds to get through the first round

each time a board is cleared, the game board will reset with one more column, one more row, an increased number of bombs and 30 seconds added to the timer

whenever a game is started, the player is guaranteed to lose, but who can last the longest? there's only one way to find out.

##Tools Used In Development
Minesweeper Marathon is built from the ground up using HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript for game logic and Jquery for animations.
